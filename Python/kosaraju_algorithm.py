================== KOSARAJU's ALGORYTHM ================== 
1) Create an empty stack 'S', do DFS on a graph, on the road, insert the vertices on top of this stack.
2) Obtain the Transpose Graph, just reverse the graph
3) One by one pop each vertex from S while S is not empty. 
4) Let popped vertex be 'v', so it will be the source, do DFS on it. The DFS starting from 'v' 
will denote the strongly connected components (SCC) of 'v', one by one popped from stack.
